## Sprint 3 Close (2026-05-27)

These decisions were made during Sprint 3 (port-level deprecation + AI Advisor) and its audit-fix pass.

### DE-S3-001: Divergence Explainer call site — post-OC in autotuner.py

**Decision:** Divergence Explainer is invoked after Overfitting Conscience in `autotuner.py`, as the final producer in the post-walk-forward advisor sequence (OC → Spec Critic → DE).

**Rationale:** Audit recommendation (S3-AUDIT-004 HIGH). OC and Spec Critic observations on the spec bundle are available inputs DE may reference in its explanation context. Invoking DE last makes downstream data available without requiring a separate query pass.

**Status:** Implemented in Cycle A audit-fix (7b47376).

### DE-S3-002: advisor_observations.symphony_id — NULLable additive column, migration 025

**Decision:** `symphony_id` is added to `advisor_observations` as a NULLable column with no default, via migration 025 (`025_advisor_observations_symphony_id.sql`). All three Phase-1 producers populate it. Existing rows without `symphony_id` remain valid (NULL = unknown/legacy).

**Rationale:** Audit finding S3-AUDIT-002 HIGH. Keying observations to `symphony_id` enables per-symphony query in `get_advisor_observations_for_symphony` and powers the `/ai-advisor` UI filter. Additive-first policy (NULLable, no destructive step) is non-negotiable per project coding standards.

**Status:** Implemented in migration 025; `insert_advisor_observation` updated; `get_advisor_observations_for_symphony` added (7b47376).

---

### DE-S3-003: NARRATOR enum retained with deferral comment

**Decision:** The `NARRATOR` advisor role enum value is retained in the codebase with an inline deferral comment. No code is deleted.

**Rationale:** Removal would be a premature destructive action. Narrator is deferred, not cancelled. Retaining the enum makes its future activation a one-line change rather than a schema migration + enum re-add.

**Status:** Binding for all future workers. Do not remove the NARRATOR enum value without a new decision entry.

### DE-S3-004: Port-level decision-math deprecation — complete; display surfaces preserved

**Decision:** All autonomous port-level decision math is removed from production code. Deleted: `engine/multi_cycle.py`, `engine/port_selector.py`, `engine/port_aggregator.py`, `engine/dual_altitude.py`. `engine/exit_authority.py` is retained as display-only badge helpers (AX-2 badge + restart_notice). Port state schema rows (e.g., `port_state` table) are preserved per additive-first policy.

**Rationale:** User mandate (2026-05-26, per `[[project-port-level-deprecation-directive]]`). Management surface collapses to symphony-level only. Display surfaces are retained because they provide operator observability without executing decision logic. Schema rows stay because dropping them in a live DB is a destructive step that violates project coding standards.

**Status:** Implemented across Sprint 3 Stream A cycles (port-settings-cleanup, port-engine-module-removal, orphan-module-removal; merged through be74f4f).

### DE-S3-005: CVaR-divergence REJECT — no signed-divergence number in production

**Decision:** No signed CVaR divergence scalar is persisted, displayed, or passed to any downstream consumer. This REJECT from cycle planning is a hard constraint on all future Divergence Explainer changes.

**Rationale:** The CVaR-divergence detector idea was rejected at the decision-science council level (see `[[project-cvar-divergence-validation-wall]]`). Relocating the validation problem onto a ~5–15 independent regime-shift count does not escape the data wall. The Divergence Explainer writes only natural-language explanations keyed to CVaR window comparison; it never surfaces a scalar divergence value.

**Status:** Binding. Verified intact through Sprint 3 audit close. Any future proposal to add a divergence scalar requires a new council-level decision and a new entry here before implementation.

---

### DE-S3-006: compute_composition_hash promoted to database.py

**Decision:** `compute_composition_hash` is promoted from the deleted `engine/port_selector.py` into `database.py` as a stable public function.

**Rationale:** The function is a pure deterministic hash over symphony composition data. Its natural home is alongside the database accessors that consume it. Promoting it to `database.py` avoids orphaning the callers and eliminates the engine-layer import dependency.

**Status:** Implemented in Sprint 3 audit-fix Cycle B (be74f4f).
